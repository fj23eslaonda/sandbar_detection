# Sand Bar detection

This repository allows to identify sand bar using wave breaking patterns. To obtain wave breaking patterns is used a method propuse for SÃ¡ez et al. (2021). The wave breaking patterns are binary matrix, where 1 corresponds to breaking. To identify sand bar, the method apply a cumulative sum over all masks.
